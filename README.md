## Contents

This repo contains

1. supplement.pdf -- PDF of supplemental materials and all files (including code) to build this document. Includes additional sampler versions, proofs of results, construction of concliques for graphs with incident neighborhoods, and a spatial bootstrap example.
  - supplement.tex -- a tex file with the final text of the supplement. Built by compiling the .Rmd files in supplement_files/docs-rmd/. 
  - supplement_files/ -- a folder containing the .Rmd filed to build the .tex in docs-rmd/ and all figures included in figure-latex/
2. code_appendix -- all necessary R and C++ scripts for generating the figures in the main paper. Also contains an instructional README to describe the file structure.
3. README.md -- this instructional README document.
